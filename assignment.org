* Task
In groups of 2 (or 3), create a simple command line tool in Babashka.

- e.g. CLI tool to:
  - [[https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc][analyse a programming project (lines of code, comments etc)]]
  - convert currency
  - calculate total size of a folder, etc

* Notes
- Try to make something presentable for your git portfolio
- A tool that you might genuinely use
- An Earnest Failure has Meaning - try to put in genuine effort and grow from this experience

* Deliverables
- code as a working Babashka executable
- with instructions/README on how to use the executable
- document explaining how and where you have used functional programming concepts in the project


* Rubrics
|                   | Points |
|-------------------+--------|
| Below Target (BT) | 0, 0.5 |
| On Target (OT)    | 1, 1.5 |
| Above Target (AT) | 2, 2.5 |
|-------------------+--------|

** Functional Programming Concepts
- BT: Explanation of 0 or 1 FP concepts used
- OT: Explanation of 2 to 3 FP Concepts used
- AT: Explanation of 4 to 5 FP Concepts used
** Code
- BT: Coding Clojure like an imperative language
- OT: Some hints of using Clojure as a FP language
- AT: Good wield of Clojure
** Usability
- BT: Non-extensible, only works for very specific context
- OT: Could use some more refinement
- AT: Tool that I can see myself or others genuinely using
